    <h1>To learn HTML</h1>
    <H2>What is HTML ?</H2>
    <P>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a coding language used to create the basic structure of web pages,
         defining how text, images, links, and other multimedia elements should be 
         displayed on a website by instructing web browsers how to render them; essentially acting as the foundation for building 
         web content, 
         with additional styling applied through CSS and functionality added with JavaScript.

        Key points about HTML:
        Structure:
        HTML uses tags (like <p> for paragraphs, <h1> for headings) to define the different elements on a webpage and their hierarchy. 
        Visual Display:
        While HTML sets up the basic structure, it's primarily CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that controls the visual appearance of the page, like colors, fonts, and layout.
